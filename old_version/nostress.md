### NoStress

**NoStress is an AI based tool that predicts work related stress levels by using data collected via smartphones, wearables, services such as email, calendar, weather information, and self-reports of stress and well-being.**

The concept is to extract features from these data sources and develop a personalized model to predict and flag that an individual is at risk of suffering from harmful stress. This will make it possible to intervene in an early stage, to minimize the risk of chronic stress-related illnesses. 

The **value** for individuals using our product is to get insights on the link between workload and stress levels, which allows them to better manage their stress. 

NoStress also allows businesses to access anonymized, department-level data on stress, and data that can help to detect lack of resources on a team/department level. NoStress wishes to result in higher employee satisfaction scores. 

With NoStress our team has reached the finals of Accentureâ€™s HumAInity Challenge 2020, selected as one of the 4 finalists out of 60 proposals.
