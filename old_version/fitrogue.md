### FitRogue

FitRogue is a game that uses health and wellness data to determine a user’s progress in a rogue-like dungeon. The tag-line for FitRogue is **Your health in an emoji rogue-like adventure**.

The game connects to the Google Fit services to read the user’s health data and depending on the stats (number of steps, hours of sleep, hours of meditation) provide different options for armours, weapons, and features in the game.

With FitRogue our team won the Junction 2019 hackathon challenge by Rovio, imagining Angry Birds in 10 Years. 

The game is fully functional and the next step is building on top of it with additional functionality in terms of user login, tracking over time, gamification, and integration of additional sources.
