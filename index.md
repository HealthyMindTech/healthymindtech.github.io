### Our projects

#### NoStress

NoStress is an AI based tool that predicts work related stress levels by using data collected via smartphones, wearables, services such as email, calendar, weather information, and self-reports of stress and well-being. The concept is to extract features from these data sources and develop a personalized model to predict and flag that an individual is at risk of suffering from harmful stress. This will make it possible to intervene in an early stage, to minimize the risk of chronic stress-related illnesses. NoStress allows businesses to access anonymized, department-level data on stress, and data that can help to detect lack of resources on a team/department level. Additionally, NoStress wishes to result in higher employee satisfaction scores. 

With NoStress our team has reached the finals of Accenture’s HumAInity Challenge 2020, selected as one of the 4 finalists out of 60 proposals. We currently have an interactive prototype that can be demoed to potential users in order to refine the design and proceed with implementation and release. 

#### Fitrogue

FitRogue is a game that uses health and wellness data to determine a user’s progress in a rogue-like dungeon. The tag-line for FitRogue is “Your health in an emoji rogue-like adventure”. The game connects to the Google Fit services to read the user’s health data and depending on the stats (number of steps, hours of sleep, hours of meditation) provide different options for armours, weapons, and features in the game.

With FitRogue our team won the Junction 2019 hackathon challenge by Rovio, imagining Angry Birds in 10 Years. The game is fully functional and the next step is building on top of it with additional functionality in terms of user login, tracking over time, gamification, and integration of additional sources.
