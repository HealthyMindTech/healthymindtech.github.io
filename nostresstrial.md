### NoStressTrial

The NoStressTrial is a platform for planning, running and reporting on clinical trials. It is specifically designed for small biotech and pharmaceutical companies that often lack the financial and human resources needed to bring new innovative products to market. 

The solution will increase SMEâ€™s capabilities to test and bring innovative biotech solutions on the market and be able to compete with big players in a cost-efficient way. This will in turn benefit the EU market, with more opportunities and competition, and faster advancement in the medical sector.
